# File Organizer
Note that the file organizer is still under development.

## Overview
The file organizer will watch a user defined set of directories for changes, including new, modified, or deleted files, and take actions based on the file type and change type. The directories to watch and the actions to take for each file type and change type will be defined in a UNIX style configuration file and displayed and editable in a GUI.
